STRV Test Project
=================

Description: Simple App displaying current weather and forecast in several locations.

Features:
========
- App will set your **current location** via CoreLocation and add it to user manageable locationList
- App can show **current weather** and **forecast** for next 5 days ( limit for FREE API ) -  via World Weather Online AP  
   - App automatically updates weather with NSTimer
- App is written in **swift** and follows **STRV guideline**
- App is **fully configurable** with `config.plist`  ( Weather API, weather update interval, default settings... )
- App uses Storyboards and AutoLayout, `NSNotificationCenter`, Dependecy Injection ( *@see* `DI.swift` ), Design patterns, Lazy initialisation, secured connections via **HTTPS** etc..
- App has user settings of length & temperature unit - stored via `NSUserDefaults`
- App can search locations via World Weather Online AP
   - Searched term is **highlighted** in found locations ( even in the middle of  )
- App has user defined list of locations - stored via `NSUserDefaults` and `NSKeydArchiver`
   - using `CoreData` is not recommended in this scenario. 
   - A) There is few items
   - B) We require more than one `ManagedObjectContext`, because we don't want to manage locations found via location search - these are only temporary record.  Merging found item to managed locationList is too complicated
- Custom TableCell animation for location view controller
- Another **custom TableCell animation** location search view controller
- Another TableCell animation for Forecast view controller   
   - There are presented some additional (duplicate) rows here ( for demo purpose - it can be easily turned of in method `TableView:numberOfRowsInSection:` )


Roadmap: 
=======
- Sharing is not fully implemented, because it is not crucial for this kind of app. Moreover i doesnâ€™t make sense to share weather via another service than Twitter and Facebook... 
- There are missing many images for weather (`Icon_Big.png`) - so i display only Windy, Cloudy, Sunny and Storm 
- RTLabel (3rd-party library) causes some warning with 64bit iOS Devices (  )

Dependencies:
=============
- **CocoaPods**
- **AFNetworking**
- RTLabel - can format

Used tools:
-----------
- Git & GitHub 
- Photoshop
- Spark Inspector
- Dash (documentation)
- StackOverflow
- Apple Documentation
